Build a Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System (full-stack web app) using the following stack:

Backend: Python (Flask)

Smart Contract: Solidity (Voting.sol)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Flask templates)

Blockchain Connection: web3.py (connect to local Ganache)

🎯 Core Requirements
🔐 Admin Control Panel

The Admin Dashboard must have 3 toggle buttons to control system phases:

Registration Phase (ON/OFF)

Voting Phase (ON/OFF)

Result Phase (ON/OFF)

Only the admin can switch between these states.

Each phase’s current status must be displayed at the top of every page (e.g., “Registration Phase: ACTIVE” or “OFF”).

🧾 Registration Phase

Active only when the admin turns it ON.

Voters register using:

Full Name

Aadhaar Number

Aadhaar Validation Rules:

Must be numeric only (no letters or symbols).

Must be exactly 12 digits.

If invalid → show red error message (Invalid Aadhaar number. Must be 12 digits.)

Prevent registration if invalid.

Store registered voters in voters.json (locally) and optionally on blockchain.

🗳️ Voting Phase

Available only when Voting Phase is ON.

Registered users log in using Name and Aadhaar Number.

Once logged in:

Display candidate list (3–4 demo names, e.g., "Candidate A", "Candidate B", "Candidate C").

Allow voter to vote for exactly one candidate.

Use Solidity Smart Contract (Voting.sol) to:

Store votes securely.

Prevent double voting (mapping of Aadhaar → hasVoted).

Count votes per candidate.

After voting, show a success message: "Your vote has been recorded successfully!"

🏆 Result Phase

Available only when Result Phase is ON.

Display:

Each candidate’s vote count.

Highlight the winner.

Results fetched from the blockchain (via web3.py).

🧩 System Logic

Use Flask routes and templates:

/                 → index.html (homepage)
/admin            → admin.html (admin dashboard)
/register         → register.html (registration form)
/login            → login.html (voter login)
/vote             → vote.html (voting interface)
/result           → result.html (display results)


Each route should check which phase is active.
If a user tries to access a disabled phase → show message:
⚠️ “This phase is currently turned off by the Admin.”

🪙 Solidity Smart Contract (Voting.sol)

Example structure:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Voting {
    struct Candidate {
        string name;
        uint voteCount;
    }

    mapping(string => bool) public hasVoted;
    Candidate[] public candidates;

    constructor(string[] memory candidateNames) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < candidateNames.length; i++) {
            candidates.push(Candidate(candidateNames[i], 0));
        }
    }

    function vote(string memory aadhaar, uint candidateIndex) public {
        require(!hasVoted[aadhaar], "Already voted");
        require(candidateIndex < candidates.length, "Invalid candidate");
        candidates[candidateIndex].voteCount++;
        hasVoted[aadhaar] = true;
    }

    function getCandidates() public view returns (Candidate[] memory) {
        return candidates;
    }
}

⚙️ Integration Details

Use Ganache (or any Ethereum testnet) to deploy the smart contract.

Use web3.py to:

Connect Flask backend to deployed contract.

Call contract methods (vote, getCandidates, etc.)

Flask should auto-refresh pages after phase changes.

Start app with:

python app.py


Run on port 5000.

🧠 Additional Requirements

Show clear alerts (Bootstrap or plain JS) for all invalid inputs.

Code must be clean, modular, and fully commented.

All pages should have a consistent header showing current phase status.

Ensure full compatibility to run directly on Replit without manual setup.

✅ Goal:
A fully working blockchain-based voting web app with admin-controlled phases, Aadhaar validation, secure vote storage, and dynamic result display.
